# Kickstarter_Analysis
An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends for Louise
## Introduction

Various kickstarter campaigns may fail or gain traction depending on several factors. These include where the campaign is being run, the purpose of the campaign, amount requested, timing of the campaign among others. Under the this project, we used Excel to analyze data from some crowdfunfing campaigns in some 21 countries to detect the drivers of success or failure
The data is further analysed to reveal  why some campaigns succeed and others don't.

### Findings

1. Campaign Launch Date
The time a campaign is launched determines it's success rate. Those launched in May from the analysis received a higher success rate

2. Location and Type
It was revealed that, the location of campaign and the type of campaign influence it's success. Theater campaigns in Great Britain particularly plays for instance were more successful than same in the US

#### Recommendation
1. For a successful campaign, Lousise should launch her campaign in between April and July, but most preferably in May since this is when most campaigns are successful
2. The goal of her campaign should be less than USD 4000. This is because an analysis of the central tendencies revealed that, the median of the goal and pledge for all successfull campaigns were USD 3000 and USD 3168 respectively
3. The IQR of all successful goals and pledge were USD 3500 and USD 3982
